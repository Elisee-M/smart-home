## 🚀 Project Overview

**SmartNest** is an **IoT-based home automation system** designed to promote sustainable living by intelligently managing home and environmental resources.  
It integrates multiple sensors and actuators to **monitor**, **analyze**, and **automate** essential household systems — from lighting and irrigation to parking and weather monitoring.

---

## 💡 The Challenge

Modern homes often waste **energy** and **water** due to inefficient manual control.  
NASA’s global sustainability challenge inspired us to design a system that helps reduce resource waste through **smart monitoring** and **automation**.

---

## 🔧 Our Solution

SmartNest uses **IoT sensors** connected to a **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** to collect environmental data and automate actions such as:
- Watering plants when soil is dry 🌱  
- Turning lights on/off via a web dashboard 💡  
- Monitoring parking slots using ultrasonic sensors 🚗  
- Tracking temperature and humidity in real time 🌡️  

Users can control everything from a **web interface**, with live data display and alerts.
